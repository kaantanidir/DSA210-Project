# AI Usage Documentation

AI tools (large language models) were used in a limited and transparent manner
during this project to support the development process. AI assistance was
primarily utilized for the following purposes:

- Drafting and refining project documentation (e.g., README formatting and clarity)
- Brainstorming project structure and research questions
- Debugging Python code logic and identifying potential data leakage issues
- Clarifying data science concepts and evaluation methodology

Example prompts included requests such as:
- Reviewing machine learning evaluation results for potential data leakage
- Improving clarity and academic tone of documentation sections
- Identifying appropriate statistical tests for comparing feature distributions
- Debugging path and data loading issues in Jupyter notebooks

All AI-generated suggestions were carefully reviewed, validated, and, when
necessary, modified by the author before being incorporated into the project.
No AI-generated outputs were used directly as final results without verification.

All data processing, feature engineering, modeling decisions, and result
interpretations were performed solely by the author.
